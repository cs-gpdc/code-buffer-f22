**Challenge Name**  
Good Prime Pair

**Description**  
Check whether two numbers are prime and their concatenation is also prime

**Problem Statement**  
The Vice Chair of CSGSA, [Aishwarya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-satwani-baaa6612b/), finds prime numbers fascinating. She is studying some special categories of prime numbers and has stumbled across a category that involves concatenation, which she calls 'Good Prime Pairs'. She defines a Good Prime Pair as a pair of prime numbers $P$ and $Q$ such their concatenation $concat(P,Q) = PQ$ is also a prime number. If the given pair of numbers is a good prime pair, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

**Input Format**  
The entire first line contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $Q$.  

**Constraints**  
$1 \leq P, Q \leq 10^5$ 

**Output Format**  
Print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes)
