**Challenge Name**  
Experiment on Word Properties

**Description**  
Remove words whose properties are already present in some other words

**Problem Statement**  
The Vice Chair of [CS-GPDC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cs-gpdc), [Sachin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachin-sharma-cu/), is running an experiment to study the properties of words. A word is a sequence of letters, $W = L_1 ... L_N$ of length $N$, and has $N$ properties. Through his previous experiments, Sachin has already established that when a new letter $L$ is added to a word $W_0$ of length $N$ to form a new word $W_1 = concat(W_0, L)$ of length $(N+1)$, it retains the original $N$ properties of the original word $W_0$, and gains a new $(N+1)^{th}$ unique property generated by the concatenation of $W_0$ and $L$. Sachin wants to analyze all the properties of words in a given list. However, since the properties of some of the words are already present in some other words, he wants you to filter out such words from the given list and generate the final list of words in ascending order.

**Sample Example**  

```text
5
app
banana
a
apple
abc
```

The properties of the word **app** are already present in **apple**; hence, we filter it out.  
The properties of the word **banana** are not present in any of the words in the list; hence, we keep it.  
The properties of the word **a** are already present in **app** and **apple**; hence, we filter it out.  
The properties of the word **apple** are not present in any of the words in the list; hence, we keep it.  
The properties of the word **abc** are not present in any of the words in the list; hence, we keep it.  

Hence, we print each word on a new line from the final list of words {**banana**, **apple**, **abc**} in ascending order {**abc**, **apple**, **banana**}.

**Input Format**  
The first line contains an integer $N$, the number of words.  
The next $N$ lines contain one word $W$ on each line.

**Constraints**  
$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$  
$1 \leq W.length \leq 10^5$  
$1 \leq \sum W.length \leq 2 \times 10^7$  
$W$ consists of lowercase English letters only  

**Output Format**  
Print each word on a new line from the final list of words in ascending order
