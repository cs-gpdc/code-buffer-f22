**Challenge Name**  
Why not Y

**Description**  
Check whether the string contains all vowels

**Problem Statement**  
One of the most helpful volunteers in the CS department, [Nishant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishant-bhattacharya-a41396101/), has been assigned the task of checking whether a given sentence contains all vowels and all consonants. As an efficient engineer, he has already broken the task into subtasks and delegated the subtask of checking vowels to you while he takes care of the consonants. Nishant likes clarity and simplicity, so he has decided to treat the ambiguous Y as a consonant. If the given sentence has at least one occurrence of each of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u), print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

**Input Format**  
The entire first line contains the sentence $S$.  
$S$ consists of uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, symbols.

**Constraints**  
$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^3$ 

**Output Format**  
Print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes)
